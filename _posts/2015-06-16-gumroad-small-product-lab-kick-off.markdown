I have had many false starts to building the next genre-defining product over the years. 

First there was the replacement for Google Reader, 4 years before it Google shuttered it. Then there was the flowchart software I developed for an accountant friend of mine, shelved at the beginning of tax season. I started with Web-based, real-time trending software for manufacturing companies. Next came heat-map process diagram overlays. Finally I developed a manufacturing operations internal Twitter-like system.

When I was into running, I created a run tracking app. When I left the wonderful world of employent to become an entrepreuner I made a "what I did today" tool.

Inspired by Nathan Barry,  Amy Hoy, Brennan Dunn and others, I created an ebook on building business systems. A how-to guide to design the tools to run a business, without  software developers swindling you.

The last attempt was a web-based system for Lobbyists to manage their legislative duties. This one was just poor timing due to many factors, and was the first one to cost me anything more than time.

Each of these experiences gave me valuable knowledge. The trick I have yet to put in place is to start with the audience first. Launching to an unsuspecting world using a tweet, or cold-email to a customer is a good way to get zero excitement.

I decided to go back to basics this time around. Start as small as possible, build an audience, and launch in a better attempted version of the "right" way. My goal as of last week was to start yesterday, June 15th 2015. 

In what I can only describe as the most convenient timing of the last year, I opened my Inbox in Sunday night to an email from Gumroad. It described their 10 day Small Product Lab Challenge. 10 days to make something from scratch, some built-in audience of other people in the challenge, and a kick in the pants to get it done? Sign me up!

Day one was about setting a goal. Done.

Day two is about deciding what to create.

My creation is going to leverage some of my hard knocks in business. It will be an e-book going through the background and exercises for the reader to tell a better story about themselves. Instead of using a hammer to hit potential clients over the head, it is sales and marketing done through a relate-able story. Stories better convey your values, and ideas, and the transformation you provide. 

I haven't set up what the product looks like yet, this is at least going to be my next step. Likely it will be what is in tomorrow's email. 

Tomorrow we will dive into the process as I put together some of my outlines and goals for the product.

Time to stack the bricks, check the boxes, and get to work!
