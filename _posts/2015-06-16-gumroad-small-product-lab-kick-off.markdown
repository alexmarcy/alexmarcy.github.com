I have had many false starts to building the next genre-defining product over the years. 

First there was the replacement for Google Reader, 4 years before it was shuttered. Then there was the flowchart software I developed for an accountant friend of mine, shelved at the beginning of tax season. Web-based, real-time trending software for manufacturing companies, heat-map process diagram overlays, and a manufacturing operations internal Twitter system all were developed but never got off the ground.

A run tracking app when I was really into running, and a "what I did today" tool I used when I left the wonderful world of employment to become a founder.

Inspired by Nathan Barry's foray into info-products, followed by Amy Hoy, Brennan Dunn, Sacha Grief, and others, I put together a 100 page ebook about building business systems, basically designing the tools to run operations more smoothly without being swindled by software developers.

The last attempt was a web-based system for Lobbyists to manage their legislative duties with better reporting for clients. This one was just poor timing due to a number of factors, and was the first one to cost me anything more than time.

Each of these experiences gave me valuable knowledge. The trick I have yet to implement is to start with the audience first. Launching something to an unsuspecting world using a tweet, or cold-opening to a customer what I have been doing on my "off" hours is a good way to get zero excitement.

I decided to go back to basics this time around, start as small as possible, build an audience, and launch in a better attempted version of the "right" way. My goal as of last week was to start yesterday, June 15th 2015. 

In what can only be described as the most convenient timing of the last year, I opened my Inbox in Sunday night to an email from Gumroad describing their 10 day Small Product Lab Challenge. 10 days to make something from scratch, some built-in audience of other people in the challenge, and a kick in the pants to get it done? Sign me up!

Day one was about setting a goal. Done.

Day two is about deciding what to create.

My creation is going to leverage some of my hard knocks in business. It will be an e-book going through the background and exercises for the reader to tell a better story about themselves in a business context. Instead of using a hammer to hit potential clients over the head, it sales and marketing done through a relate-able story, conveying values, ideas, and the transformation your product or service will bring to their life. 

I haven't set up what the product looks like yet, this is at least going to be my next step, likely it will be what is contained in tomorrow's email. 

Tomorrow we will dive into the process as I put together some of my outlines and goals for the product.

Time to stack the bricks, check the boxes, and get to work!
