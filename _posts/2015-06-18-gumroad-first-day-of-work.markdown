description: Gumroad Small Product Lab - First Day of Work
---

Life felt like it needed to happen yesterday, so progress on the Gumroad challenge was slow. I was very productive in other areas, but not on the product. Luckily I will have quite a bit of time over the weekend to make up for it.

Today was the first day of "actual" work on the product. I laid out most of the outline (still need to pull a Derek Sivers and <a href="https://sivers.org/get-specific">get specific</a>), and threw together a quick draft of my landing page. I didn't find a book layout or put all of the chapter headings and such into place, so I rearranged my to-do list a bit to move the landing page stuff up a day and re-arrange my tasks.

I went the longer form instead of the Gumroad Audience route, and got a bit of flack on the Facebook group, but what can you do? I like long form sales pages. The process of getting sucked in, raising objections then squashing them, building momentum, coming up with great lines, all of that is so exciting to me. The part I struggled with is in the graphics department, I still need to come up with some interesting graphics to keep people moving down the page and engaged. I did get three people to sign up, so that is better than I can say for any other similar sales pages I have written.

I'm excited to see the progress other people seem to be making in the group, it will be interesting to see how many new products get launched on the 24th. I am confidently hopeful I will be among them, even if it still needs some polish after the fact. Start small, see what works, adjust, and repeat seems to be the way to do it.

The real power of the challenge so far seems to be forcing myself to come up with an idea in one day. Too many times in the past have I gotten lost on a project in that phase, never making to an outline. This seems to be the exact outcome <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth Godin</a> was providing with his Ship It workbooks. Basically get rid of all of the BS and come up with an idea. If it is a decent one, give it to some of the low-hanging fruit of scrutiny and get on with your day. 

Enough rambling today, I should probably start focusing on a story for future posts since my product for the challenge is "<a href="http://alexmarcy.com/storyselling.html">Story Selling</a>" (a play on Storytelling, hilarious!).

Focus on stacking the brick in your hand, not the entire pallet of them behind you.
