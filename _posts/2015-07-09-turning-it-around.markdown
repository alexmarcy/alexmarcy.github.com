Have you ever driven a hulking SUV with a terrible turning radius?

Trying to do a u-turn in one on a busy street without an extra lane is impossible. It becomes a 5-point turn and you will get honked at. You realized a block too late you had missed the turn to get to the beach. A fun day planned, now tarnished by frustration.

Sometimes life can feel like the SUV you are trying to turn around. No matter how hard you turn the wheel you never seem to get anywhere. People are yelling at you left and right and all you want to do is get out of the way. You want to get onto the next thing. You want to get to the fun event you scheduled. You want to stop worrying about everything.

It doesn't have to be that way. Let go of the baggage. Get rid of the insecurity. Toss out the 48 oz. sodas, candy bars, and chips.

The trick is finding a smaller car, one easier to turn around when you need to. 

The dealership is in your head, they are selling an attitude. Find the one with all the upgrades, and don't worry about the negotiation. It will all pay off in the end.
