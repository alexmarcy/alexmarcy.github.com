Today was the day I tackled Chapters 1 and 2 of <a href="http://alexmarcy.com/storyselling.html">Story Selling</a>.

I made it through with no noticeable bruises or scars, and learned quite a lot during the process. Writing seems to provide a lot of clarity about any given topic, especially when I am writing in the context of teaching a topic. For Story Selling, this meant clearing up the flow of information from the beginning of the book to the end. As I was writing the chapters I kept seeing these little threads pop up and I decided to pull on one in my mind, which unraveled a new way of looking at the process of building a story for a business.

It wasn't a huge leap, the flow of information is still the same, I just became aware of a deeper way of connecting the dots by using different layers of the process as the foundation of what comes later.

Put simply, the power of stories can be amplified by letting the audience know you care about the outcome, demonstrating your values as a person/business, talking about your achievements, and your vision of the future. Logically it all makes sense, but I hadn't really thought about the underlying implications in a lot of detail before. You need to care about something before you can have values surrounding it. Your values will inform your actions/achievements, and your vision will be based on your previous outcomes.

Simple yet very powerful.

Tomorrow is Chapters 3 and 4 followed by editing the landing page, Chapters 1 and 2, and making sure all of my Gumroad information, account info, etc. is up to snuff so I can release Story Selling on the 24th.

Feeling like the end is in sight!
