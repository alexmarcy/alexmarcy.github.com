How much of your day-to-day work life is doing something repetitive? Taking customer orders, troubleshooting tech support issues, meetings, processing payroll, the list goes on. 

What do these and a lot of the tasks you do on a day-to-day basis have in common? First they all have a valuable desired outcome, otherwise you wouldn't be doing them. Second they have some sort of process to get them done. What else in life is similar? If you add a list of ingredients to the mix wouldn't you have a recipe?

If you think about it doesn't your business have a list of ingredients? The time you spent in school learning any technical skills that got you to this point, your previous work experience, any partners or staff you have and all of the tools and information you use to make decisions and execute your plans, these are all examples of ingredients.

If you were to mix ingredients with all of your daily tasks you would end up with a recipe. If someone executed your processes with the right ingredients they would probably end up close to where you are now.

Where did your recipe book come from? Maybe you have an education as your foundation. You might have learned from a book by a successful business person or have seen someone in action you chose to mimic. You might have picked up ways of doing things from your previous jobs and you have probably made some tweaks along the way. This is no different than cooking.

How easy is it to get comfortable with a recipe? Think of one of your favorite meals when you were growing up. When you were old enough to get the recipe and make it how did it work out the first time? Did it taste just like you had remembered? What about the second or third time you made it? What about after you had a few attempts under your belt and you asked why yours wasn't as good as you hoped it would be? You may have found that the recipe as written is not how it is prepared. After years of making the same dish there might be a few steps or ingredients that have been modified. These changes were just part of how things were done and no one thought to update the copy of the recipe in the book.

If you were using this recipe in your business how would this affect things? What if you had done things the way they always had been done, trained someone new to take over for you when you went on an extended vacation and came back only to be left picking up the pieces? How far did your work deviate from the policies and procedures you gave your backup? Did you make special note about all of the shortcuts and tweaks you have found out over the years? Are you even aware of all of those tweaks?

Filling in for someone on vacation is only one example of a time when it would be great to have an up-to-date recipe for your business. If you grow as a company and bring new people on board, how will you train them? What if you want to change your day-to-day roles or focus on bigger picture items as a business owner? How easy is it for someone else to pick up your duties and run with them? What happens if something happens to you or one of your staff members and they aren?t able to follow through on their workload?

<h3>Surprise!</h3>

At my last job there was a guy named Phil who was the epitome of productivity. He juggled more projects than anyone else at once, always had glowing reviews from his clients and always managed to come in on time and under budget. One day he went in for back surgery to fix a lingering problem. He worked from home for a few weeks while he recuperated and shuffled his field work around to coincide with his return. He didn't drop any balls during this time. Phil had also lived with epilepsy his entire life.

Phil ran into an issue when his pain medication started inhibiting his epilepsy medication and one day Phil didn't show up for work. He had passed away from a seizure in his sleep. It was not only the loss of a great co-worker, also of a friend and close confidant of everyone in the office. He was truly missed and clients still talk about him to this day.

While this loss was devastating the company recovered. His projects were shuffled around and while there was a lag in getting everyone up to speed, everything got taken care of and all of his clients were happy, or so we thought.

One day about 6 weeks after he passed away A client called asking when Phil was going to show up for their scheduled meeting to discuss commissioning a project he was working on. Everyone looked through the jobs folder on the server and couldn't find any record of this project. There was no information in the office contact list for them and the only record was an invoice the accounting department found for the initial work Phil had done for the client. We looked through his computer and found the project files ready to go out to the client?s facility and handled the project from there.

What would have happened if everything hadn't been in order and a client called out of the blue asking for status on a project no one knew about and no work had been done? We would have lost a lot of face and left them in a bad spot.

Had nothing happened to Phil there wouldn't be a story to write about the unknown project. While preferable, it gave us a chance to revise our policies and procedures, our recipe, for how we handled projects.

Do you have anything in your business that could end badly if you ran into a Phil situation? Coming up with a recipe might even be something on your to-do list. While it probably isn't a terribly interesting or "sexy" item to complete you could easily make the argument it should be one of the most important tasks you can tackle.

<h3>Sharpening Your Tools</h3>

What if you do have some processes in place? Are your desired outcomes matching where your business is now? Are your processes up-to-date? Do you have an easy way to determine if they are being used and if they are being used correctly? If your staff has found some good shortcuts or changes, how do you include those into your training? Are your processes supported by tools that make them easier to complete? Keep in mind the goal of a recipe is to achieve a desired outcome by completing a specific set of tasks using a specific set of ingredients. 

If your business was a recipe would you want to work with the right tools? Would you want the best tools? Are you working with the best ingredients? Are you making lots of small batches of something when you could make one large batch and divide it into smaller portions? 

Another way that business is similar to cooking is recipes can very greatly between regions, cultures and individual people. This is to say that my desired outcome, while similar to yours, might have a completely different way of being achieved. This might involve different ingredients, different processes to work with those ingredients or a totally different way of thinking.

<h3>Familiar Ideas Presented in Unfamiliar Ways</h3>

One example is on an episode of PBS's show starring Chef David Chang, "The Mind of a Chef". In this particular episode Chef Chang explores a handful of other chef's approach to cooking an egg. Chef Wylie Dufresne, proprietor of WD50 in New York, takes a completely bizarre to conventional cooking approach through the use of a genre of cooking called molecular gastronomy. Molecular gastronomy involves the use of cooking techniques based on chemical interactions between ingredients to present food in new and interesting ways. 

Chef Dufresne demonstrates his approach to making eggs Benedict. He deconstructed the standard expectation of what eggs Benedict is and created a new version from the ground up. His version starts with making a long plastic pouch and filling it with egg yolk. If you haven't seen the episode imagine a large Otter Pop filled with egg yolk. He experimented with cooking times and temperatures in an immersion circulation bath to find the perfect result for his yolks. He describes the yolks in this process as "having the texture somewhere between a cheese and a fudge."

He cuts three inch or so long pieces of the yolk from the resulting tube and puts them in the oven for a bit. While those are cooking he takes his version of Hollandaise sauce which is a typical sauce mixed with gelatin and a starch to form a cube shape. This shape is then breaded with english muffin breadcrumbs and deep fried.

To present the dish he smears the yolks onto the plate, adds some black salt and some chives for color and places the hollandaise cubes on the plate with some bacon. If you haven't seen the episode, you should watch it, his plate looks delicious.

The key takeaway from this is Chef Dufresne started with a known outcome, eggs Benedict, and decided to work with the ingredients using out-of-the-box techniques he was familiar with to allow his vision to come through in the final product. His goal was to present something very familiar in an unfamiliar way. This caused the leap between your expectations and what is served to not be as big as if he presented a similar dish made of unfamiliar ingredients. Leaving one foot in the known and usual world it allows him to push boundaries of the unusual even further.

To fully embrace your processes it isn't simply enough to copy down a list of what has worked for other companies. While it is entirely possible to repeat someone else's steps and achieve some level of success with the results, you will always be chasing someone else's outcomes. To transcend those trappings you need to find what energizes you, what works for your business and embrace the strengths and weaknesses you bring to the table.

<h3>The Tools</h3>

In addition to the processes you will develop you will want to take a similar approach to the tools you will  use to execute your vision.

There are any number of off the shelf tools you can use for just about any part of your business. From accounting and payroll to project management and client interactions you can find a handful of solutions online. With today's API based systems you might even be able to string many of these systems together to run your business with a seamless transition between the different tools. 

You may find that there is some component of your business not supported by off-the-shelf tools, or you require some additional customizations not available to you. In this case it makes sense to find a way to implement your processes in a way better suited to you. You might also find yourself at the mercy of the ever-changing software landscape where the tools you rely on are no longer available or a new version has crippled a feature you rely on for a core business process.

This is a good reason why you should not use off-the-shelf tools for core business processes. Just like you would not outsource your designs if you were an architecture firm or outsource your baking if you were a bakery you should keep your core competencies in-house. Not only because you can control how things are done and at what level of quality they are completed but also because your core competency is usually the basis of the value you provide to your customers.

Is your core competency tracking customer contact information or is tracking customer information merely something you need to do as part of your business? Unless you are developing a customer relationship management system as a product you probably don't need to invest the time and resources to develop a custom CRM system. If you simply use accounting as part of your process to process payments and payroll you are probably fine with an off-the-shelf solution. If you are an accountant you will likely use some industry standard software as part of your business, and would want to develop and maintain other tools related to the value you provide to your clients. If you are a graphic design firm you wouldn't merely be a middle man between your clients and a website like 99Designs so you would want to develop some sort of system to increase the value you add to your clients.

This doesn't apply to some fields where industry standard software has become the norm. Examples being Quickbooks for accounting, AutoCAD or RevIt for engineering/architecture or Photoshop for graphics. This would be the equivalent of a baker designing and building their own mixer or a sushi chef making their own knife. The baker needs to know how to use a mixer just as the sushi chef needs to know how to sharpen their knives. These are simply tools used to produce the products that add value to their customers lives.

What do you need to develop? An accountant might need a way to notify clients they have received payments, have bills due or tax responsibilities. A graphic designer needs a way to communicate the process to their clients, perhaps a way to get feedback on initial sketches and track changes on the way to the final result. An engineering team might need a project management tool well suited to the type of work they are doing that can track progress in terms of work completion and budget constraints. Any of the tools that directly support what you do best should be well researched to see if they can add more value to your team, your business and your clients.

This is not to say you need to develop complex systems for their own sake. Chef Dufresne uses some interesting techniques and equipment yet he still uses the same over and stovetop, pots and pans and utensils available to you or anyone else. He simply approaches them with a different outlook than conventional wisdom would suggest he should approach his craft. 

<h3>Processes to Make Your Life Easier</h3>

How can process help keep you focused on what you do best?

One industry using process to keep themselves focused is large scale government contracting. Think something like Raytheon, Lockheed Martin or Northrop Grumman. Companies like these have immense operating budgets and the ability to take on large-scale, long-term contracts providing any manner of work for the federal government. Anything from consulting services to research and development to equipment design and manufacture.

With a seemingly infinite number of potential projects available for these companies to bid on each year they need to have a process in place to decide what projects match their overall strategy for the marketplace, aren't in conflict with other projects they are currently working on or are looking into, have the manpower and resources to devote to executing the project successfully and think they have a high likelihood of winning the bid.

From discussions with people in this industry it is common practice to have a process in place simply to decide what projects a company like Lockheed Martin would be interested in bidding on. 

This process starts with a list of all potential projects available at any given time. These projects are usually filtered based on the type of work to limit the number of projects any one person needs to review. From this list of all projects the departments can quickly decide some of the projects are simply not worth the time to research beyond a quick once over. Maybe it is a project outside of the companies areas of expertise, it would conflict with something else or is a sole-source contract being put out to bid simply to meet legal requirements.

All of the projects making it past the first stage have now reached the phase requiring some level of detailed research. This phase determines if the project is worth investing the time to develop a proposal. Here the various departments will review the projects in more detail to determine the requirements, competencies required, schedules, etc. Projects that for whatever reason are not deemed worth developing a proposal on are thrown out at this stage.

For projects worth bidding on a final stage is used to determine how likely a project is to be awarded to the company. Projects with a low chance of being awarded may be thrown out at this stage and projects with a high likelihood will make it through to the proposal development phase. There are any number of reasons why a project will have a high or low likelihood of being awarded. Existing relationships, previous experience with various entities involved, specific requirements in the bid documents the company may or may not meet, bonding and insurance requirements, etc.

After projects make it through this phase the company will develop a proposal and submit it to the appropriate entity. From there it is up to various factors to determine if they will be awarded the project or lost it to someone else.

The reason behind this process is the high cost of developing a proposal. Generally there will be a huge amount of research required to make sure all of the project requirements are met, a large amount of supporting documentation needs to be put together, pricing for labor and materials needs to be obtained and so on. By reducing the number of projects the company will develop proposals for they can save a lot of time and money by focusing only on projects they are confident they can win. It also prevents them from jumping into a new project without having buy-in from all affected areas of the company. Engineering may not be aware of resource shortages in IT, field testing staff or manufacturing capabilities. By taking on a project simply based on engineering's recommendation the company could easily be put into a show-stopping situation. Instead, by requiring buy-in from the various departments the company can keep its strategy and abilities in mind and only take on projects it can handle or grow to meet the demand in time for the work to be completed.

While your processes may not be as detailed as this process to simply decide what work to bid on you might be surprised to find ways to save time and resources if you developed a process and framework to standardize decision making for your company.
