An old NES game, Contra Changed my life.

At some point during my childhood I watched some older kids play it while our parents were wrapping up dinner and I was waiting to go home.

I was mesmerized. I loved the idea of the power-ups. I thought the mechanic of laying down on the ledge to shoot the red dot on the first level "boss" was ingenious and the forward facing levels were simply mind-boggling.

I put together an imaginary version of the game when I got home that involved some hand-drawn powerups taped on the wall, G.I. Joe action figures as the bad guys, and a wooden rubberband gun with different color rubberbands for the various guns.

With no prior knowledge of how games were created I somehow pieced together the idea of someone creating Contra and implanted my less-than athletically inclined version of the sports hero as career dream. I wanted to become a video game developer. Years later I would get kicked off the "fun" team in the lowest tier softball league because I was so terrible.

Being a child of 1984 my computer access was relegated to school, learning to type, mostly playing Odell Lake, and sometimes Oregon Trail. It wasn't until a few months after Pentium Processors had come out that we had a Gateway PC at home. Internet access was still a few years away so I mostly played whatever games I could get my hands on.

In middle school I learned about the concept of software development but had no means to do much of it. In high school one of my friends had a copy of Visual Studio C++ which I installed and learned everything I could through the included tutorials. That was basically the end of my formal education in software development.

Being the first person in my family to go to college my ideas about what it entailed were pretty limited. It seemed pretty obvious once I thought about it later on but it never once occurred to me to look into Computer Science. I found out the department existed my sophomore year when our Chemical Engineering classes moved into the computer lab but could not fit any classes into my schedule.

I did manage to go back after I spent a year learning C++ on the job while I worked at the customer counter in a county permitting department. I managed to fail out of CS-102 when my schedule no longer worked out with class. I never went back to school and I never stopped learning.

I picked up SQL, various web frameworks, Javascript, and a myriad of other languages, methodologies, and ways to create general mayhem along the way.

I never picked up videogame development. I basically quit playing video games due to time constraints in college and haven't really picked it up since. I am not sad about it, there is plenty of time to create other exciting things without it.

Since starting this journey I have started my own company, shipped a lot of software, and have a new field (marketing/sales) to learn so I can make a comfortable living off of my hobbies well into my old age.

Thanks for being a part of the journey!
