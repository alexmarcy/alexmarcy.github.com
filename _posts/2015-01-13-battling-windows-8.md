Yesterday my Macbook decided to send the monitor home for the day. No Apple logo on booting, login screen, or anything else to keep me company. HDMI port in the side plugged into the TV? Nothing. Figuring out how to access my user account and login worked, resetting some form of XYZRAM and the SMC didn't work either. 

The only saving grace was that everything that was important was backed up. Except for the last 2 weeks of development time on a new product I am working on. Shit.

Luckily I was able to COMMAND + SPACE my way into terminal, hunt and peck my way to push everything to Github and be on my way.

Yeah I'm open to the possiblity of losing music, some PDFs and some songs I had been working on but losing all of my non-critical data is hardly the worst thing in the world.

A quick trip to the morale blackhole that is the North Michigan Avenue Apple store here in warm and sunny Chicago yielded 2 wonderful insights. My logic board died. It might take up to a week to get it back.

Nevermind the proposals I am working on or the commissioning I have to go take care of during that week. Forget about the iPad, Generation 1, Launch Day special I have used for cinematic glory for the last 5 years, I need a real deal computer.

A quick assessment of the family's computer situation, I hoped would lead to buying a new Macbook to replace an aging one at home, instead led me into the shady underworld of Best Buy.

For the record I checked Costco on my phone in the parking lot and was not blown away by their price to RAM ratio. If I couldn't get out with a machine capable of saving my ass on a job-site with VMWare I would have gone back out to the blistering heat of a Chicago January with no snow and trekked my way to $1.50 hot dogs and a Coke. I managed to find an HP with an AMD processor and 8GB of RAM for less than $500.00.

Wait, my first computer's entire hard drive was 750 MB, I could literally fit more than 8 of that machine in memory on this one for 1/6th the cost. And, it comes with a fucking touchscreen. The day I reach up and touch my laptop's screen will be the same day I decide I would love to become a politician. I am still completely perplexed as to why I would want to get fingerprints on my screen. I don't think this is a case of me being a complete moron like the time I thought a pre-Redbox machine was the stupidest thing I have ever seen, or the time I thought an iPod was the dumbest way to listen to music one could possibly come up with. Oh well, some people may want to get some greasy chicken fingerprints going and save that flavor for later.

We haven't even gotten to the good part of the story yet. That is Windows 8.

I remember distinctly going from an Apple II to Windows 3.1, then to Windows 95/98, then to XP, Vista, and finally 7. Every single time it was like a new universe of awesomeness had opened up. Better graphics, better performance, better games, better EVERYTHING.

What was better than Windows 7? OS X. Hands down, no questions asked. 

Going from OS X to Windows 8 was the first time I have ever felt like I was going back to the old computer in the closet to do my taxes or get some obscure file I had used once before. It is almost painful.

Everything is slightly messed up or completely out of order and none of it makes sense.

Maybe I am just a bitter curmudgeon, but I can't wait until the moment I get my hands back on that Macbook. It will be a huge relief.
