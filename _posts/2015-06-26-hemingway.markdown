Today I bought the Hemingway app on my Mac.

Since I started writing, a lot of common criticism is that my writing is long-winded and not as clear as possible.

When I copied some of my most recent stuff into Hemingway, the page looked like the aftermath of a ketchup and mustard food fight. Someone must have brought some blueberries and grape juice to the party too.

Lots of hard to read sentences (yellow). Even more very hard to to read sentences (red). Adverbs as far as the eye can see (blue). Words or phrases that can be simpler sprinkled throughout (purple).

Who would have thought someone could mistake my writing for abstract art?

I'll admit, so far it is a bit painful to strip out some of my natural style, but it does read better, and doesn't seem to be as confusing to read.

In some way Hemingway seems to make my writing more conversational. I think that will be a good thing in the long run.

If only I would have had this app in high school, maybe Mrs. Rishel would not have told me to never write again in Junior Year English.

Luckily I stuck with it, got some accolades the next year, and haven't stopped since.

Cheers to the writers of the world, and please be sure to keep some of the colors flowing in Hemingway, it would be sad to lose all the confusion writing helps me clear up.
