Yesterday I launched <a href="http://alexmarcy.com/storyselling.html">Story Selling</a>.

I started from scratch 10 days ago with a blank Pages document. I spent some time outlining the book and what points it needed to address. I wrote the chapters, edited everything, put together a cover, and changed the landing page a few times.

During the 10 day challenge, 4 people signed up for my list, making this my most successful launch in terms of subscribers ever. The first launch, some web-based trending software was to zero people. My previous launch of project management software for lobbyists was also launched to zero subscribers, but I had a list of 700 or so emails obtained from the state's lobbyist registration system.

So far that puts me at 3 for 3 launches with no sales. While the monetary gains have been zero to date, the lessons learned have been huge:

<ol>
	<li>Don't launch a product with zero feedback from potential customers (first launch)</li>
	<li>Have some traction before launching (all launches)</li>
	<li>Having a blog, with evergreen content, especially if it is highly targeted/niche content can drive traffic very easily.</li>
	<li>My copy isn't the worst thing in the world, and aside from launching products, has worked on my consultancy's site to the tune of many proposals being submitted.</li>
	<li>As the ever-interesting <a href="http://www.garyvaynerchuk.com">Gary Vaynerchuk</a> would say, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fsYWXrGGcE">One is greater than zero</a>.</li>
</ol>

I say one is greater than zero because thus far I have only been growing. I went from zero subscribers on the first launch, to 4 on the latest. I learned a lot along the way, and have a lot more information to keep moving forward.

Now it is time to leverage the work I put in over the 10 days to make <a href="http://alexmarcy.com/storyselling.html">Story Selling</a> better, improve the copy, get more people interested in it, and get to the first sale.

Want to join me in this next challenge?
