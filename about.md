Hi, thanks for visiting my site. I'm Alex Marcy.

I design software, write about things that interest me and teach other people to do the things I know how to do.

I am currently wrapping up my first book, [Building Business Systems](http://alexmarcy.com/buildingsystems) and will continue adding to my bookshelf after its release.

Outside of work I enjoy playing guitar and writing music, running and spending time with my family.

Please feel free to [contact](mailto:alex@alexmarcy.com?subject=Hello) me with any questions, ideas or just to say hello.

Thank you.

Alex Marcy
