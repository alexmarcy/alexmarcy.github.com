You care about running your business as efficiently as possible. Everything you do has a cost. If you can reduce the amount of work required to complete a task you can directly impact your bottom line. 

What if you could reduce your costs and also give yourself flexibility to get out of the trenches? Is there an interesting project you just need some more time to explore? What if there was a way to make it easy to delegate more responsibility to your staff with repeatable, successful results?

Achieving these results doesn’t require you to hire any “rock-star” talent or investing additional hours during the day to make sure everyone is focused. It only requires leveraging the right tools to manage the information you already use in your day-to-day life. 

This idea can be seen in a lot of areas. If you get a flat tire on the highway what do you do? You open the trunk, pull out your tire iron and the spare and change tire. When you take your car into the shop to get the tire fixed what do they do? They pull out the air-powered hand-tool that lets them remove your wheel in the same time it took you to undo one of the lug-nuts.

If you have a file anywhere in your office with hand-written, mission-critical information, you are using a tire iron. If you have a folder on your computer filled with Excel documents for your monthly numbers you are using a tire iron every time you need to compare two months’ data.

If you are using a tire iron, what does an air-powered hand-tool for your business look like?

A lot of companies might use an Access database. That gives you a central location for your data and makes it easier to track down and compare information than your hand-written files or your Excel documents. As your business grows you will eventually run into some issues with Access as your only tool. Performance degrades as the amount of data increases and you might have multiple versions of your application floating around leading to data integrity issues.

If you have reached the limits of Access or want to skip the growing pains altogether, a better option is a database with a website front-end. This is what companies move to when they have outgrown Access.

You get the benefits of a central location for your data, you can use the latest and greatest functionality of your web browser and never have to worry about someone entering data using an old version of the interface. You can also better track who is interacting with your data and can easily incorporate things such as email, security and data-validation before the data ever gets into your system.

The other benefit to a database-backed system is the ability to run reports on your data to easily compare month-to-month or year-to-year performance and provide all of your staff with standardized metrics and analysis tools to make sure everyone is on the same page.

Why would you not want to use a system like this that can significantly reduce the amount of time you spend searching for data, compiling reports and making sure all of your metrics are correct?

You might think it is a difficult proposition to incorporate your existing systems and forms into this format, that it might be costly or difficult to use or that your data might not be safe from prying eyes.

These are all valid concerns. The most common one is that your data might not be safe. Your data will actually be more safe in a database than in an Excel document. You can limit who can access your data at the database level, preventing employees with the know-how to get the data out of the database from doing so. Your data cannot be easily emailed as an attachment like an Excel file can and you can store all of your data on your own network further preventing access to unwanted intruders.

The difficulty in moving from your existing forms to a browser-based system is trivial. Any hand-written forms can easily be transferred by setting up the database and a couple of webpages to access the data. All of your functionality from Excel can be integrated into the new system and you can gain a whole new level of reporting and analysis capabilities in the new system.

The cost is likely not as high as you would expect and can be reduced by having an understanding of what the final product will look like before you reach out to someone to help you develop the system.

You only need a basic understanding of the capabilities of a database and web-based tools to communicate your needs for such a system and the abilities it can provide. 

In upcoming posts you will learn what questions you need to ask prior to calling anyone to develop your system, what a new system can do for you and how you can easily put together a list of requirements that can form your scope of work.

You will see some case studies on projects that have turned hand-written and Excel-based forms into browser-based tools and some of the powerful reporting and analysis tools that were available with the new systems. 

You will also learn about the tools that you can use to develop browser-based tools and how you can build low-cost systems that you can expand upon as your company realizes the benefits and efficiency gained from using the right tools for the job.
