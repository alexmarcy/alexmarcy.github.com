The first step in the process of using a new tool for your business is to understand your business processes. What are the things you do on a regular basis? Of those things, what ones require information to be collected and saved? For those tasks, how are you saving data at the moment?

Let’s say you run a small brewery. You take your raw ingredients, run them through the mashing and boiling processes, let the liquid ferment and then put it into bottles. If you are interested in producing a consistent product odds are that you have a clipboard with various data points for each batch. The amount of raw ingredients, what variety of hops, how long you boiled everything, various temperatures, fermentation duration, the list goes on.

Once you have completed a batch and run it through quality control you might have some more data points that get written down and stored somewhere. The data you have collected for a batch of product is a prime candidate for building a new data management system.

Instead of taking the top sheet off the clipboard and putting it into a file why not get more value out of the data? You already spent the time to collect it and write it down. Why not spend a minute or two to enter it into your system where you can use it? Better yet, why not get rid of the clipboard altogether and use a tablet to enter the data directly into the system when you collect it?

The real value of the data comes when you make subsequent batches and you get more data. What you are doing with the data will determine its level of usefulness. If you make a particularly great tasting batch can you easily identify what was different about the process compared to a normal batch? Would you like to be able to repeat your results and have the ability to spot trends in how you are doing things? When your product gets picked up by a distributor and you need to increase production how well does your clipboard scale?

These questions are all things that a large company like Anheuser-Busch has answered. They track a ton of data about every batch. If something ends up tasting weird in the end product they can compare that batch to every other batch in their database and diagnose likely causes. They track what the effect of various ingredients have on the final product and strive to brew consistent tasting product at all of their facilities. Granted they automate a lot of their processes, simplifying data collection, however the concepts transfer to any size company.

Instead of your clipboard being the final home of your data imagine you open a web-browser, log in to your system and input your data into your database. At each step of the process you can pull up a report comparing this batch to all of your previous batches and get a detailed view of how it compares. You can even have a good idea of what your final product will look like based on all of your existing data.

The added benefit to this new system is that you will find new information that would be difficult to track down by comparing hand-written data. Maybe you have a higher amount of waste on one type of brew than another. Maybe one of your crew members is involved in a lot of the particularly great tasting batches. With these type of insights the investment in your system can quickly pay for itself by reducing costs and improving your process by understanding all of the moving parts in more detail and being able to utilize them more effectively.

These concepts apply to any business. If you are in retail you can track how product placement in your store affects sales, how your staff can influence buyers at various points of the shopping experience and how well your marketing efforts are returning on your investment. Restaurants and other customer-service based industries can have similar returns.

Manufacturing can see enormous gains by tracking real-time process data, eliminating downtime by tracking what causes process upsets and standardizing process set-points across various operators and shifts.
Accounting, engineering or other technical companies can standardize project management processes, track client response times and a myriad of other data points. This leads to improved operational efficiency and more positive client interactions.

What in your day-to-day life is like the clipboard at a brewery? You shouldn’t be looking to re-invent the entirety of your operation from the get-go. Find a smaller tool that uses some data and start there. You can get your feet wet with the new system, integrate it into your workflow and get a good feel for the value it provides you. Once you are comfortable with the new tool then you can find a larger system to implement. As you continue to expand your toolset you will also find ways to leverage the same data in multiple locations to further compound the value of the new tools.

I used this approach with one of my clients who is in mining. All of their data was either in Excel or hand-written. We worked together to move their quality control data from a clipboard to a browser-based system with the data stored in a database. After a few months of using this system they found that there was someone in the shipping department that was using this data and doing one of her processes by hand. She was reading the data from an automatically generated report and writing down tests that were out of specification and flagging them. When this was brought up it was a simple process to add this functionality to their system and lighten her burden quite a bit. As this system was adopted at all of their facilities corporate saw the effect it had on the amount of time it took to work with this data and how much money they saved as a result. They then pushed for implementing similar tools for tracking process changes, collecting process setpoint data and building standardized operating procedures based on their most efficient production days.
