How are your staff, clients and stakeholders involved in your current workflow? Do you send them an email when a milestone has been reached? Do you set up a meeting and discuss this week’s action items? Maybe you have a meeting on the weekly calendar for the rest of time to go over everyone’s projects?

How much do those weekly meetings cost you? Not only in the amount of man-hours being spent in the room and time spent preparing for the meeting. What about the toll on everyone’s sanity? 

Why not build the content of the meetings into your data management system? With real-time updates as tasks are completed you won’t have to wait a week to understand where all of your projects stand. Of course you will lose the ability to get into any weekly meeting habits like letting the regulars drone on about what went on this week about what caused them to slip the schedule again or hear the latest gossip. You can easily buy a new water cooler for the gossip and everyone will be able to monitor all of the projects without having to make an example of anyone.

The way you build this information into the system can take many forms. A dashboard showing the status of your tasks, a notification system that sends out emails as milestones are completed and reminders when tasks aren’t being completed or a system to collect information from your staff on what they accomplished each day.

The method that will work best is dependent on the way your work is structured. Project based work can benefit from a project management system and can leverage various tasks and milestones as easy ways to gauge project status and estimated completion schedules. Something with a loosely defined structure can benefit from an information aggregation source where employees send an email about what they did during the day or week. Work with quick turnaround times can utilize a dashboard to display real-time analytics with reporting to compare daily, weekly and monthly turnaround times. Most companies will have all of these components or more at various points of their operation. 

We will start with the project-based approach as most companies have some sort of project in their workflow. This method applies equally well to project-based work such as construction, software development or hands-on manufacturing. To get the most use out of this system you need something that has a slow time to completion (at least a week or two) and involves some sort of standard milestones during the project’s lifecycle.

The most basic version of this system is a to-do list. To complete the project you have to execute A, B, C and X, Y, Z tasks. Each task is made up of some smaller jobs and one person is responsible for A and B while other people are responsible for C, X, Y and Z. The project manager is responsible for making sure everything gets done on-time and under budget so they need to be kept aware of when things are completed, how long they took and if they went over budget for any reason.

When the project is first started you will generate a new form in your system which requires information on the schedule, due dates for each milestone, budgetary information and who is responsible for the various tasks. The power lies in what happens next.
When the form is created an email will go out to everyone responsible for the project including the project manager informing them that a new project has been created and they are going to be involved.

The person responsible for milestone A will be able to start working on their tasks and checking them of as they are completed. They will enter their hours into the system and any overages on materials or additional labor. Once all of their tasks are completed the system will send out an email to the person responsible for milestone B and the project manager letting everyone know milestone A is complete and milestone B can begin.

Assume milestone B has some information that needs to be reviewed by a client and approved before work can proceed. When this task is being worked on the system can email the client with a link to the files they need to review. When their review is complete they can submit any comments or changes back to the person working on milestone B through the system and work can continue.

If someone is not completing tasks by their due date reminder emails can be sent out at various intervals to staff and the project manager to make sure everything is being done as expected.

This process continues through to the end of the project. When the project is complete the system can automatically generate a report for the project and send it out to everyone who needs the information.

The power of this system is that it doesn’t require meetings for everyone to get an update on where the project stands. As tasks are or aren’t being completed the project stakeholders will get automatic notifications. In addition, hey can simply pull the project up and see what has and hasn’t been completed, how many hours are remaining in the budget and if there is anything slipping behind schedule anytime they wish. 

For work that is on a shorter timeline, customer service or small projects (less than a week), a different solution can be implemented that provides real-time updates to any interested parties.

A customer service system might be used for a tech support department of a large company. Similar to the project management system when a call or support ticket comes in the staff will be notified that there is an open item to attend to. Information such as the time of the request, who sent it, what it involves, etc. can be incorporated into a dashboard that gives the staff an overall picture of what requires their attention at the moment.

As they move through the list of requests they can mark the items as complete, more information requested, etc. These status updates will show up in the dashboard automatically and additional information such as the time a request was closed, duration of the work required to fix it, who is sending in a lot of requests, etc. can all be tabulated and displayed.

This provides a real-time view of the workload with the ability to go back in time and compare current conditions with previous time periods for analytics purposes.

Both of the previous methods are designed to “push” information out to people regarding the status of a project. They require updating the form each time a task is completed and provide detailed information about the status of a project. 
Another design is one that is meant to better mimic the project status meeting while “pulling” information into the process from your staff. This type of system is good for things that are not clearly defined such as tracking day-to-day work that isn’t project related or used to facilitate brainstorming sessions or idea gathering.

This type of design can be designed as a form or can be configured to collect emails from your staff and store the information in the database. You can set up email reminders to spur the input process on a regular basis.

The way to access information in this configuration would be a report that aggregates all of the data into a useful format. You can use various fields to group the various ideas together making them easier to organize in the report as well as follow the logical flow of progression as people review and build upon one another’s suggestions.

This sort of free-form idea gathering can be useful at the beginning or end of a project or during innovation sessions when you are seeking new ideas for products, clients or processes to apply to your business.

The approach you choose to use for data gathering and management is largely dependent on what your business model requires and what you and your staff are comfortable with. The idea of bringing in a new system is not to replace what you are currently doing with some “ideal” scenario it is to provide you with additional tools to help you do your job more effectively, share information that needs to be shared and to hopefully find new and interesting ways to expand your capabilities.
